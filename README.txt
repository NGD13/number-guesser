# Number Guessing Game 

### Description
I built this number guessing game to learn and practice basic functions, conditions, and techniques for writing JavaScript syntax. The object of the game is to guess a number between 
0 and 9 while your computer also makes a guess between 0 and 9. The game will randomly generate a target number and whoever is closer to the target number will win. The game will keep
track of your score and the computer's score while also keeping track of the round you are on. If you choose a number that is less than 0 or greater than 9 the game will display an error
message asking you to try numbers 0-9.
